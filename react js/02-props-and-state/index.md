# 📦 Props & State

## Module Progress
- [ ] [[Understanding Props]] ⬇️ Passing data down to children
- [ ] [[Props Destructuring]] 🎯 Clean prop extraction
- [ ] [[Default Props]] 🔄 Fallback values for props
- [ ] [[What is State]] 💾 Component memory
- [ ] [[When to Use State vs Props]] 🤔 Making the right choice
- [ ] [[Immutability in State]] 🔒 Why never mutate directly

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Pass data between components using props
- Destructure props for cleaner code
- Set default values for optional props
- Understand what state is and when to use it
- Differentiate between props and state
- Follow immutability rules when updating state

## 📌 Key Concepts
> **Props** flow DOWN from parent to child. They are read-only.

> **State** is local to a component. When it changes, the component re-renders.

> Always treat state as immutable - create new objects/arrays instead of modifying existing ones.
